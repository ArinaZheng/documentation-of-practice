- Date: April 26, 2020
- Medium: Digital Image file produced with Adobe Photoshop
- Description: This is the first draft that I made regarding to my final project.

This is one of the three people that I interviewed for my final project regarding to the impact of the coronavirus on different people with different jobs. I put a green outline around the person in the picture and green text all over with his respond to reference the technology that I researched because the AR lens uses the same color outlines and words when displaying information to their users. The texts all over the screen symbolizes the digital world we live in connecting to the topic of this course.
