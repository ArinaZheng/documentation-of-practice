when you use those AR lenses, it gives you real time information on what you're looking at and i think in a few years as the technology evolves, these AR lenses will be able to have facial recognitions. with the pandemic going on in the world, i want to mimic the way that the chinese government collects basic information from everybody entering the country also mixed with some questions as i had to fill out multiple forms when i returned home from the states. and also questions on how has the virus made an impact on people's life, etc. the words and questions will be replaced with the interviewers info and answers. i used the same color, similar fonts and the green outline around my interviewer as the ones in the examples from mojo's official website as a referance to the company.
